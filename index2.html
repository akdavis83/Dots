    <h2 style="color: white; position: absolute; top: 100px; right: 15px; left: 15px;">The Word of God has no contradictions, it is to be read, studied, and it is to be placed in our hearts. The line of the scarlet thread runs through the scriptures from the beginning to end. That line is the blood of Jesus and this word is the Word made flesh. The Spirit, water, and the blood bear witness in the earth and they agree in one. It takes some time but the word of God is to be connected and built upon precept by precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little.</h2>

<h2 style="color: white; position: absolute; top: 425px; right: 15px; left: 15px;">Unsolved mysteries, puzzles, mazes, and enigmas are mysteries that intrigue us. The mysterious has a subtle way of capturing our attention. God's word may seem mysterious but it will not remain that way. All things in the natural deteriorate, it is just the way this world currently is. However, God's word is an inexhaustible fountain that will continue to flow forever. If it were not so it's pages would have already been discarded after thousands of years of plumbing its depths. In Christ it is not so much about right and wrong doctrine, it is about getting as close to truth as we can in this life time. We can be a Job or a Job's friend. Every man was fully convinced they were right before God and everyone else but when God showed up they all found they were all wrong in comparison to the man they were determined to condemn. Even Job was not completely right but he stood justified before God because of his words and doctrine.</h2>
